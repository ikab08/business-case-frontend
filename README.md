# business-case-frontend

The project is that of the Business Case Front End in Gozem.

In the project we created a (responsive) result page following a travel search with specific filters.

Note that for the filters we have set default values, our work being focused only on the Front End.

We also put on the page the search bar where the data would have been entered.

NB: We designed the page in English because the statement was in English.
